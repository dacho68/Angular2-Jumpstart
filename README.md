# Angular2-Jumpstart

This sample is from Youtube [Angular 2 Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Angular 2 from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-CD_5YhJTA) by Mosh Hamedi.
if you want to go deeper about Angular 2, I recommend to take the course [Angular 2 with TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-tutorial-for-beginners/learn/v4/overview) on Udemy.

- Jumpstart - Quick understanding of how to build an App with Angular 2.
- [101](https://github.com/dacho68/Angular2-101) - Property Binding, Class and Style Binding, Event Binding, Two way Binding.
- [102](https://github.com/dacho68/Angular2-102) - Component API in depth.
- 103

## Setup the environment on Windows for running the samples
- First instal [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install typescript globally

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g typings
```

We are going to use [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing our project
after you checkout this repository. Run the command below for install the dependencies

```
npm install
npm run typings install

npm start
```

As a C# developer, I find this video provides a good understanding of :

- Angular 2 project structure and setting.
- How the Typescript compiler generate the Javascript file.
- Basic Compoment syntax (metadata).
- Reference to a directive.
- Basic binding concept.
- Dependency Injection.
