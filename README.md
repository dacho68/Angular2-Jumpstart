# Angular2-Jumpstart

This sample is from the video on Youtube [Angular 2 Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Angular 2 from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-CD_5YhJTA) by Mosh Hamedi on Udemy.

- [Jumpstart](https://github.com/dacho68/Angular2-Jumpstart) - Quick understanding of how to build an App with Angular 2.
- [Part 1](https://github.com/dacho68/Angular2-101) - Property Binding, Class and Style Binding, Event Binding, Two way Binding.
- Part 2 -  Component API in depth.
- Part 3

## Setup the environment on Windows for running the samples
- First install the Node at nodejs.org
- Install typescript 

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g typings
```

We are going VSCode as our IDE, and you can download it from  code.visualstudio.com. 
after you checkout this repository. Run the command below for install the dependencies

```
npm install
npm start
```

As a C# developer, I find this video provides a good understanding of :

- Angular 2 project structure and setting.
- How the Typescript compiler generate the Javascript file.
- Basic Compoment syntax (metadata).
- Reference to a directive.
- Basic binding concept.
- Dependency Injection.
